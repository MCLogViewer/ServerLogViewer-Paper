# ServerLogViewer 📜

**ServerLogViewer** is a project that allows you to view a server's logs locally on your client.

Designed with developers in mind, ServerLogViewer allows you to quickly **search and filter** logs by Log Level, Query or by Plugin Origin!

The project is split into the **Paper Plugin** and the **Fabric Mod**. Both are required to use the Log Viewer.

## Installation & Usage

You can download ServerLogViewer-Paper at our [Modrinth page]().

For the complete Installation, Usage and other useful information, head over to the [ServerLogViewer-Fabric repository](https://github.com/MCLogViewer/ServerLogViewer-Fabric).

### ServerLogViewer-Paper

You will need to configure the plugin in ``/plugins/ServerLogViewer/config.yml`` in order to use the Log Viewer. This doesn't take long to do. You will get a message explaining what to do when you try to use the Mod for the first time too.
